# Plover

## Disclaimer

This is my first own React App. Throughout the process of building it, I want to learn the principles of dealing not only with React, but also backend development, APIs and object orientation.

**_This is App is still in development._**

## Description

Plover creates stunning covers for your Spotify playlists.

> But bro, why that name tho?
> **Well... Playlist + Cover = Plover. Pretty cool, huh?**

Just enter a _keyword_ for the picture search and your plalist's _title_.
The pictures come from Unsplash and are free to use, so you don't have to bother about rights or licenses. However, tagging the photographer in your playlist would be a neat move! You can find the artist's credentials right below your newly generated cover.

## Get started

Hit `npm install`.

To get started and be able to fetch pictures from Unsplash's API, you have to request an API key. Set up a file called `keys.js` in the `src` directory and store your API key as value of `keys.unsplashAccessKey`. After that, you should be able to call the API.
